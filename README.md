## DISCLAIMER
:warning: I do not do any GWT anymore myself, but anyone is welcome to contribute. 
I add committers on demand :)

## Description
Pure gwt composite to create easily a tagcloud of almost anything.


### Customize your view layer :

  * Either create a cloud of words, or images.
  * Prepoluate the tag cloud directly from a List, or Tag by Tag.
  * Make the cloud colored or not (randomly).
  * Customize the colors of the words.
  * Customize the orientation of the text (horizontal/vertical).

The model and control layer are already done for you : 

  * JDO(s) App Engine ready.
  * RPC Services for CRUD operations included.

A fast and easy to use pure-GWT composite, 
[http://code.google.com/p/gwt-tagcloud/wiki/Installation once the jar added to your project]
, you're ready.

If even, you wanna use the [http://code.google.com/p/gwt-tagcloud/wiki/RPCservices RPC Service], it's powered by Datanucleus through JDO. Totally "App Engine-ready" ;)

### ROADMAP : 
  * shuffled position of the tags.
  * weighted position of the tags. (highest occurencies in the middle)
